# Computer Vision Projects: Scrabble Score Calculator and Life with Louie - Face Detection and Classification

This repository showcases two projects completed as part of the Computer Vision course at the University of Bucharest. The projects delve into different aspects of computer vision, utilizing various techniques to achieve their respective goals.

## Scrabble Score Calculator
The *Scrabble Score Calculator* project focuses on creating a tool that can automatically identify letters on a Scrabble board and calculate the score for each word formed during the game. This project required the implementation of a variety of image processing techniques, including masking, thresholding, denoising, and template matching. By combining these techniques, the project successfully identifies letters on the game board and computes their scores.

## Life with Louie - Face Detection and Classification
The *Life with Louie* project tackles the challenge of detecting and classifying faces of characters from the "Life with Louie" animated series. The primary goal was to employ a sliding window technique for accurate face detection, even within images of varying sizes. The subsequent task involved classifying the detected faces into four distinct characters. To achieve this, a custom Convolutional Neural Network (*CNN*) was designed and trained from scratch. Additionally, Support Vector Machine (*SVM*) was utilized along with the sliding window technique to enhance face detection accuracy. Notably, the main challenge encountered during this project was the limited size of the dataset. Despite this constraint, the developed model achieved successful classification and detection results.

Both projects received the highest grade, showcasing the proficiency in utilizing a wide array of computer vision techniques and machine learning approaches. The repository contains the code, documentation, and any additional resources associated with these projects. Feel free to explore the codebase and documentation to gain insights into the implementation details and methodologies used to tackle these intriguing computer vision challenges.
