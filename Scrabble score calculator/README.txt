Used libraries:
OpenCV
NumPy
os

Make sure all of these libraries are working in your environment.

All the files from the directory named Code (run.py, task1.py, task2.py, task3.py, utilites.py, visualisation.py) should remain in the same directory.

To run this program you have to open run.py from Code directory.

From lines 49 to 51 you will find:
images_location, you have to change the value for this to the path of your images;
mask_location, you have to change the value for this to the path to Masks directory (the absolute path from your computer)
solutions_location, you have to change the value for this to the path to Solutions directory or the directory where you want to save the .txt files (i.e. the solutions)

For all this 3 paths you should not write "/" or "\" at the end of the path. The paths should end with the name of the last directory and nothing more.

Now just save (if needed) and run the file run.py.

Notice that it takes around 20s to save the solution for 1 image. It might take up to 1 hour to run it for 100 images.
